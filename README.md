# MNIST-Classification-SupervisedLearning
This is a Supervised Learning project which aims to Classify digits. The first approach is using ANNs and the second approach is using CNNs, with less parameters to be learned and greater accuracy. I also tried to visualized the filters as it's always a fun idea to try to cut open your CNN to gain a better intuition of what's going on.
